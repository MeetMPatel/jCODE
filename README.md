jCODE is a high-performance Fortran-based multiphase/multi-physics flow solver developed and maintained by the Capecelatro Research Group at U. Michigan. The code is capable of solving the multi-component compressible Navier-Stokes equations on structured curvilinear meshes using a class of high-order energy-stable finite difference operators. It features a range of models including Lagrangian particle tracking, combustion mechanisms, immersed boundaries, and discrete adjoint-based sensitivity. The original code was written by Dr. Ramanathan Vishnampet Ganapathi Subramanian "An exact and consistent adjoint method for high-fidelity discretization of the compressible flow equations." Diss. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2015.
